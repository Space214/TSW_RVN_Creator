# TSW_RVN_Creator
Creates Rail Vehicle Numbers for use in the Unofficial TSW Editor.

Basic setup:
enter numbers into the left text box as follows, making sure that after every number range or single number you add a line break.

8000-8010 (this will create a number range)

8000 (this will add a single unit number)

8001,8002, 8004, 8006 (this will also add single unit numbers)

In the right text box the program will generate a copyable bit of text that you can paste directly into your RVN.
